# My blog

Since I almost never post, I usually forget how to:

- Create the new post file in `_posts`; any new images go in `images`, subdirectoried by the current year.
  Be sure to set the date correctly, and `published: true`, in the metadata at the top of each post.

- Serve the blog locally with `jekyll serve`; make sure things look good.

- Commit the new post files (and images, etc) and `git push origin master`. Jekyll will run on Github Pages
  and the site will update.
