I've resurrected my blog. I started writing a couple of years ago, but
eventually the posts slowed to a trickle as my impulse to post was swamped by
the urge to tinker with the look.

I've just spent a bit of time upgrading to Wordpress 2.0 and doing my own
theme (dig the live photo banner!), and now that I have, the old posts don't
fit. Coming soon: pictures in posts, and of course, Google ads.

Update, April 4, 2006: Google ads: **check!**

Update, July 21, 2016: Now moved to Jekyll and Github Pages, and Google ads
went away a long time ago.
