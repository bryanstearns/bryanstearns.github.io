You're not a geek blogger until you've written a post live from somewhere out
in the world: greetings from Phone Company Park, section 308.<!--more--> At
this point, the local boys have a nine-run lead over the Cubs; they established
this lead early, by scoring five runs in the first 14 minutes (and that's
counting the Cubs' half of the first inning). Mr. Bonds has walked three times:
pitched around once, and the regular way twice.

(If Danger had HTTPS access to my stuff, I'd have posted the photos I just
took, but I don't want to send my password over the ballpark's WiFi network.)

(Update: photo posted.)
