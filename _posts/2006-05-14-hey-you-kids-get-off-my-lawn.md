Every year for the last dozen or so, KFOG has presented a free concert and
fireworks show just across the Embarcadero from here. The view from our place

They say 350,000 people show up for this - I'm not sure whether that counts

&mdash; but we four (Gina and I, and our friends Michael and Rina) had our own
front-row seats.
