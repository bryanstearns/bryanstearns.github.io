I spent part of Friday and Saturday evening at
<a href="http://www.socialtext.net/dcamp/index.cgi">DCamp</a>,
an event devoted to connecting <u>d</u>evelopers and <u>d</u>esigners for a
series of ad-hoc conversations. It was the first of this new kind of
un-conference that I'd attended.<!--more-->

My favorite session was Sarah Allen's
<a href="http://www.socialtext.net/dcamp/index.cgi?cinematic_user_experience"
target="_blank">talk on Cinematic Web Design</a>: the idea that interaction
design can learn a lot from cinematography was backed up by a few great demos
of her work on <a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/">Laszlo</a>
applications and a clip from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034583/"
target="_blank">Casablanca</a>. I've had trouble buying into all the Web 2.0
hype, but several notions from this talk are helping me sort the important ideas
from the chaff.

I also took notes at a talk on Friday on
<a href="http://www.socialtext.net/dcamp/member/index.cgi?open_source_and_usability_session"
target="_blank">usability in open source software</a>: one of the key thoughts
here were that one of the reasons that open source software UI design is so
generally bad is partly because designers don't really have the "currency" it
takes to get to leadership roles on open-source projects. Coders can contribute
patches, then become committers when their patches look good, and committers
can become leaders; designers have trouble participating in this trust economy.
(The schism between mantras was also pointed out: developers "scratch their own
itches", but designers avoid the thinking that they're their own target users.)

Overall, I had a great time: I met several new people and had several good
conversations.
