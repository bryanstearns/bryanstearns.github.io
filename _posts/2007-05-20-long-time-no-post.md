I just finished attending <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails/"
target="_blank">RailsConf 2007</a> here in Portland, barely a week after
attending the first <a href="http://barcamp.pbwiki.com/BarCampPortland1"
target="_blank">BarCampPortland</a>... they've inspired me, and I'm hoping
that this post starts a more public period of blogging for me - I'm hoping to
have more interesting things to say (but we'll see!)...
