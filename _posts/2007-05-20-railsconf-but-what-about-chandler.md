I'm still working away at <a href="http://www.osafoundation.org/"
target="_blank">OSAF</a> on <a href="http://chandlerproject.org/"
target="_blank">Chandler</a> &mdash; I've just been playing with
<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/" target="_blank">Ruby</a> and
<a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Rails</a> in my spare
time. I don't expect that to change, but you'll see more Ruby/Rails postings
here than Chandler postings - I'll keep my Chandler contributions on the
Chandler blog and mailing lists.
