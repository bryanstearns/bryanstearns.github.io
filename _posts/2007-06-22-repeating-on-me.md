Gina noticed a leftover half burrito in the fridge just now. She asked where
I'd gotten it - I told her it came from Loco Loco, a food trailer on Alder near
9th. Then I admitted that I actually prefer Loco Loco's burritos to
Ol&eacute; Ol&eacute;'s or Cha! Cha! Cha!'s. Then I realized what I'd said.
