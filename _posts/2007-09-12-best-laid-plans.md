This morning's Oregonian newspaper had <a href="http://blog.oregonlive.com/breakingnews/2007/09/old_lesson_on_apollo_10_reappe.html">this story</a> (sorry, they forbid linking to the photo) about
a newly-uncovered schoolroom chalkboard that still bore a lesson from 1969: in
neat block lettering, the board says:<!--more-->

> ### Apollo 10
>
> Apollo 10 is on the way to the moon.<br/>
> It has three astronauts aboard.<br/>
> They will look closely at the moon.<br/>
> They will splash down on Sunday.

That this amazing simple quote survived (behind the now-worn-out green
chalkboard that replaced the old one) is fascinating. However, my favorite part
isn't that quote: it's this little list visible on the far right side of the
chalkboard:

> ### Plans
>
> read<br/>
> write<br/>
> work<br/>
> color<br/>
> choose

I'm gonna get a reprint of this picture for my office, just so I can use this
list in my own planning.
