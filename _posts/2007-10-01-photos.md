I just got back from an OSAF Sprint Week in San Francisco -- all the remote
folks "come home" every so often to work together in the office, and we were
celebrating <a href="http://blog.chandlerproject.org/2007/09/11/preview/"
target="_blank">the Preview release of Chandler</a>.

I took my new camera along, and shot a few photos of
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bryanstearns/sets/72157602222267844/">my coworkers at lunch</a>,
and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bryanstearns/sets/72157602223067755/">more just walking around the city</a>
&mdash; mostly during an evening walk with Ted Leung, who I'm learning a lot
from. (Those are links to my new Flickr account - you can get to all my pictures
using the new link over there in the sidebar.)
