Just returned from a much-needed vacation on Kauai. I've been there several
times before, but it was Gina's first time - we both had a great time, we
snorkeled, we relaxed & read, the weather was great, wish you were there, blah
blah blah.<!--more-->

The high point of the trip was our second day there: we took the tour of
<a href="http://steelgrass.org">Steelgrass Farm</a>.

> ...a multidisciplinary educational center for agriculture, music and the arts.
> On the agriculture side, we're a demonstration farm with extensive plantings
> of bamboo, cacao (the chocolate tree) and vanilla, working to develop Kauai's
> future as a center for sustainable, diversified agriculture by providing
> hands-on training, workshops, and educational tours for residents and
> visitors.

Going in, we didn't know what to expect, but we **really** enjoyed the tour:
we were led by the owner, Tony Lydgate, and his daughter Emily. They've been
working on this place for eight years or so, starting by ripping out most of
the existing overgrowth, then planting a huge variety of mostly-native plants
and trees: the selection "was based on the desire to have varieties that provide
food, or that are indigenous, decorative or medicinal, or useful in crafts or
construction," and everything is maintained organically.

In addition to the bamboo for which the place is named, they also tried to grow
bananas, but that turned out to be a learning experience: there's a blight on
the island, and their bananas didn't survive it. Almost by accident, they
discovered that cacao seem to do well there, and the trees' natural enemies
happen to be insects that the local wild chickens find tasty (organic!). Since
then, they've been producing cacao seedlings, and have been spreading them
around the island - they hope to get enough under cultivation to make a co-op
feasible (which the island could really use: we saw hardly any sugar cane in
our trips around the island; even as recently as seven or eight years ago, I
remember lots of it).

During the tour, Tony and Emily were enthusiastic about sharing their breadth
of knowledge with us, in fascinating detail, from botany to economics. They
have lots of stories about how the place came to be: what worked and what didn't
along the way. We got to taste a lot of fruit right off the trees, like
acerola berries (very tart, just like the vitamin C tablets made from them),
Meyer lemons, limes, guavas, and plenty of starfruit; after each sample, the
cores, peels, pits, and seeds were tossed in nearby brush - organic! They're
also working on "cultivating" vanilla; though it's not ready for tasting, we
saw pods dangling from the vanilla orchid vines in the trees, and to hear about
the manual pollination process they used.

Then, the chocolate. Tony broke open a ripe pod, and we got to sample the seeds
as Tony explained the strategies that cacao has evolved that allow it to
flourish. From there, we sat in an airy tent and got to blind-taste and compare
a variety of high-end dark chocolate bars (and as a result of the tasting, I've
got a couple of new favorites).

All in all, a terrific morning &mdash; if you're going to be in Kauai, I
recommend it (though it's probably not for kids: there's a lot of botany before
you get to the chocolate).
