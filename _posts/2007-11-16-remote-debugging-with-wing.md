I just wrote up <a href="http://chandlerproject.org/Journal/RemoteDebuggingWithWing">a
bunch of notes on the Chandler wiki</a> about remote debugging with Wing (the
Python IDE), having just finished a session where I fixed a problem that only
occurred on an automated-build machine hundreds of miles from here (with two
firewalls between me and it).<!--more-->

The Wing docs treat remote debugging as an "advanced topic", but it really works
well once you get over the setup hurdles. Even if you're just doing remote
debugging from a different machine on your desk, it's a real boon when working
on UI code to not have your debugger's mouse and keyboard interfering with the
target's mouse and keyboard... so give it a try.
