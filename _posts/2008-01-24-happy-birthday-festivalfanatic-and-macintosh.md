Finally got the initial release of <a href="http://festivalfanatic.com">FestivalFanatic</a>
into production today: when it grows up, it'll be a tool to let people get more
out of going to film festivals. It's also a tool to prove that I can do
soup-to-nuts Ruby on Rails development.<!--more-->

Today's version doesn't do much (actually, the live version doesn't do
**anything** yet!), but I expect to add a lot of utility between now and when
the Portland International Film Festival starts.

(Today's also the 24th anniversary of Apple's announcement of Macintosh - am I
really that old?!)
