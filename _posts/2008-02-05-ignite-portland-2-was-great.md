Gina and I went to <a href="http://igniteportland.com" target="_blank">Ignite Portland 2</a>
tonight, a collection of 5-minute presentations where the slides advance
automatically every 20 seconds.<!--more-->

That misses the essence, though: there were a huge variety of subjects,
amazingly good (and passionate!) presenters, and a wonderful community feel
(even with the Bagdad Theater packed with 700+ people).

You can <a href="http://www.igniteportland.com/2008/02/here-come-the-videos/" target="_blank">watch the videos</a>,
and whet your appetite for next time (I'm ready already!).
