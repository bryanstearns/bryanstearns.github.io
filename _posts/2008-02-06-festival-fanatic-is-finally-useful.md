I <a href="http://selfamusementpark.com/2008/01/24/happy-birthday-festivalfanatic-and-macintosh/">mentioned</a>
a few weeks ago that I'd been working on a film festival scheduling site,
<a href="http://festivalfanatic.com">FestivalFanatic.com</a>. Though it went
live then, it really hasn't been useful without any festivals configured.<!--more-->

As of this morning, though, it now has the Portland International Film Festival
schedule in it, and nearly everything I wanted in the first release is working
&mdash; the notable exception being automatic scheduling, which I hope to finish
in a day or two.

It's been hard to find time to work on Festival Fanatic, though, because I've
been attending press screenings for the past week and a half (two a day), plus
there's been two Portland Center Stage events and Ignite Portland. Starting
tomorrow, it gets worse: there are still press screenings during the day, and
the regular festival screenings in the evening. I'm really glad my push for 1.0
is done!
