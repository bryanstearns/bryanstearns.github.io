The Portland International Film Festival is finally over, and though I'm
exhausted from the arduous schedule I kept (I saw every film I could - 70
features and 4 collections of shorts), I had a great time &mdash; even better
than last year, largely because of the wonderful collection of people I met
during the festival.<!--more-->

One of the best perks of Silver Screen membership at the Northwest Film Center
(which puts on PIFF) is the ability to attend the press screenings that begin
a couple of weeks before the festival's official start: seeing the two press
screenings each day opened up a lot of slots during the official festival.
A nice side effect was that there were a bunch of other die-hards who attended
most of the press screenings too, and since we'd all seen the same things
already, we tended to make the same choices of festival screenings as well.

I also met several people who introduced themselves as users of
<a href="http://festivalfanatic.com">FestivalFanatic.com,</a>
the site I created to manage my own schedule. It was also nice to see strangers
carrying printed schedules produced by Festival Fanatic (note to those folks:
improving schedule printing is near the top of my to-do list!).

Incidentally, the schedule for San Jose's
<a href="http://cinequest.org">Cinequest</a> festival is up
on FestivalFanatic.com now, for my Bay Area friends who'll be attending.
