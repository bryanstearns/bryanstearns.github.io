While working on setting up
<a href="http://festivalfanatic.com/" target="_blank">FestivalFanatic.com</a>,
I realized that some of its features would be useful to conference attendees as
well... and since the obvious domain name was available, I registered it.

Cut to yesterday evening:<!--more--> when I actually finished the work setting up
<a href="http://conferencefanatic.com/" target="_blank">ConferenceFanatic.com</a>,
I <a href="http://twitter.com/bryanstearns/statuses/777716301" target="_blank">twittered about it</a>
(and mentioned that FestivalFanatic.com has Amazon DVD links now - hint, hint)...
and as it happens, someone I follow (and who follows me) is presenting at the
<a href="http://www.postgresqlconference.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL East conference</a>
this weekend - she registered and told me about it using the feedback mechanism.

I also noticed that LinkedIn now has a Twitter-like mechanism, so I added a note
there about my two sites.

Cut back to the present, 24 hours later: The
<a href="http://conferencefanatic.com/conferences/pgsql_2008" target="_blank">PostgreSQL East schedule's up</a>,
and half a dozen new people have signed up to use it. Also, I got a terrific
email message from another ex-Apple-ite who'd seen the LinkedIn message, saying
great things about ConferenceFanatic.com and what it can become - very
encouraging.

(I also got feedback via this site's mechanism, from someone about a startup
opportunity - that was encouraging too; Derrek, I'll be in touch.)
