I <strong>like</strong> chocolate milkshakes, in ways that the HTML "\<strong\>" tag can't
really convey.

So a couple of years ago, to keep myself from going all Elvis in my senectitude,
I adopted a rule:<!--more--> I'd only have a milkshake as we reached each thermometer
milestone of 10 degrees Fahrenheit: I'd have one on the first day we hit
80&deg;, one when we hit 90&deg;, another at 100&deg;, and should we hit
110&deg;, I'd still be able to celebrate.

Unfortunately, I was cheated: I was out of town for the first two 90&deg; days,
then we went straight to 100&deg;. (And no 110&deg;, boo hoo.)

This year, I'm not taking any chances: I'm starting at 70&deg;. I deserve it,
too: we haven't hit 70&deg; yet this year, and we're almost halfway through
April already. I further deserve it because
<a href="http://www.coolmoonicecream.com/">Cool Moon</a>
has been open since last November, just across the park, and I've been able to resist.

Tomorrow, however, the forecast is for 75&deg; - Cool Moon, I'm coming for you.
