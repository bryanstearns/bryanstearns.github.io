Christmas was a big holiday for my Dad: each year, he'd send out custom
Christmas cards with obscure messages. He'd look forward to the phone calls
that would result -- people asking for hints, or badgering him for the new
low of that year's wordplay. He'd usually chide them (truthfully) that I'd
gotten the answer in only a minute or so - I think my fondness for solving
puzzles was inherited from his fondness for creating them.

It's been 35 years since the first of these cards - I'm starting a new
tradition, posting them here for the holidays. Here's the first one.
