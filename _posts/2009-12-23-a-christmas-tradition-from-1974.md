Last year I started a new tradition and posted <a href="{{ "/a-christmas-tradition-from-1973" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">
my Dad's first "obscure" Christmas card from 1973</a>; this year's reposted
card appears just in time, because technical difficulties knocked this
site off the air for the last couple of weeks.

Here's Dad's 1974 card - it's one of his easier ones, made even easier when
I tell you that those white dots on the right were made with a punch and go
through the card. Merry Christmas!
