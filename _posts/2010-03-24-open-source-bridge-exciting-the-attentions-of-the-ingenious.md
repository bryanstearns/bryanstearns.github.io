I'm reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594484015?ie=UTF8&tag=festivalfcom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1594484015">"The
Invention of Air" by Steven Johnson</a>, which talks a lot about Joseph Priestly's
experiments with electricity, discovery of oxygen, etc, and also about the
scientific community of the time: Priestly had many interactions with (and got
much encouragement from) Benjamin Franklin; Thomas Jefferson is also involved
in the story, but I'm not to that spot in the tale yet.<!--more-->

Where I am in the book (p71), there's a quote, the last paragraph from a
September 1753 letter from Franklin to botanist Peter Collinson:

> These Thoughts, my dear Friend, are many of them crude and hasty, and if I
> were merely ambitious of acquiring some Reputation in Philosophy, I ought
> to keep them by me, 'till corrected and improved by Time and farther
> Experience. But since even short Hints and imperfect Experiments in any
> new Branch of Science, being communicated, have oftentimes a good Effect,
> in exciting the attentions of the Ingenious to the Subject, and so become
> the Occasion of more exact disquisitions and more compleat Discoveries, you
> are at Liberty to communicate this Paper to whom you please; it being of
> more Importance that Knowledge should increase, than that your Friend should
> be thought an accurate Philosopher.

(You can read the whole letter, which details Franklin's recent researches
into electricity, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=haAQAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PR8&ots=7KRsnEOo-9&dq=ben%20franklin%20peter%20collinson%201753&pg=PA148#v=onepage&q=&f=false">here</a>
&mdash; it starts on p148, ends on p153.)

I'm inspired to post this here because I happened to have just registered to
attend Portland's <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/" target="_blank">Open Source Bridge conference</a>,
coming up June 1-4 &emdash; the open source movement is the next Age of Enlightenment.
