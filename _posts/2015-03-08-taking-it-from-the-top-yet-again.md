This blog has been offline for several months; I rebuilt my server, and have
been spending more time coding than writing.

I know I've <a href="{{ "/taking-it-from-the-top" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">said it before</a>,
but I hope to post more frequently again - we'll see how long it lasts this time.
