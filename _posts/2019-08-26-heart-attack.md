TL;DR: I had a heart attack; looks like I’m gonna be fine.

Early week we learned that our basement floor will need to be jackhammered up to replace a broken sewer pipe under it, so I started moving stuff out of that part of the basement, up the stairs to the garage. Including a bunch of boxes of books.

Afterward, my chest felt a little tight - I figured I was just unused to that kind of work lately. On Saturday, I went swimming for the third time this week, but stopped early because I could feel the tightness while swimming.

Yesterday, Sunday, was just like the rest of the week, except that after our early dinner the tightness increased noticeably in 10 minutes, crossing into the “uncomfortable” range. I asked Gina to drive me to the hospital, and off we went. During the drive, the tightness spread across my upper back, which was worrisome, but there wasn’t any nausea, trouble breathing, or any substantial pain.

We got to the hospital and Gina dropped me off at the ER door. After waiting my turn and saying “chest pain”, I was immediately taken back and they did an EKG, which told them “heart attack” right away.

They took me to a different room, and as I changed into a gown, ABOUT A BILLION PEOPLE came in to help. (This is a teaching hospital, and I think that’s great; in this situation it seemed like there were a dozen people in the little room with me, and a dozen more in the hallway.) Other doctors got paged, the cardiologist explained that they were going to put in a stent via an artery in my wrist and got my consent, then off we went to the cath (-eterization?) lab.

This room seemed bigger; I met several people, including the doctor performing the procedure. They moved me from gurney to a bed under what I think was an X-ray machine set up to move axially around me - I couldn’t see much else, and everyone seemed at least 10 feet away. The procedure wasn’t uncomfortable; I remember a local anesthetic needle stick, and the slightly weird feeling of something being fed in, but little feeling in my heart other than the chest tightness.

Oddly, I wasn’t really focused on what specifically was going on - the conversation between the participants was technical, and though I eventually figured out that when I heard some of my high-school human physiology terms relating to relative body directions (like “caudal”, posterior-ward), the doctor was commanding moves of the x-ray thing. Which also zoomed close to my face a lot.
 
They used a balloon they’d inserted to expand the clogged artery, then positioned a stent to hold the artery open from now on. The doctor told me when they’d done this, and it wasn’t until then that I realized that the chest tightness was gone.

A short while later (I think this was maybe an hour after we got there, 90 mins at most) they wheeled me to a room at the cardiovascular ICU.

The rest of the story so far is happily boring. I’m basically being watched for improvement, specifically to one blood chemical that the heart releases when it’s damaged - they want to see it peak (which it now has, midday Monday) and come down. I get lots of tests, here in my room: more EKGs, a lengthy ultrasound, etc. I didn’t sleep much last night, not because it was noisy - it was super quiet - but because I sleep on my tummy and that doesn’t work with all the monitor wires.

They moved me a few rooms down the hall in the middle of the night (I think for staffing reasons) to a room with an amazing view (unless one is in bed, which faces away from the window. I walked, no problem. That’s where I’m now, but I’ve made enough progress that they’re going to move me down a floor to cardiac care, to free up my ICU bed. In the meantime, I can now walk around the floor by myself (once I wrangle the two gowns I wear to avoid inadvertent mooning), and move myself to the chair by the window to enjoy the view. I’m also passing the time watching Netflix on my iPad - the WiFi seems great. Oh, and writing this post.

I think the plan is to send me home tomorrow, along with new drugs: a statin to help with cholesterol buildup, a blood thinner, a beta blocker that’ll reduce the work my heart is doing, other drugs to “help the heart’s remodeling happen right” (I know they don’t want platelets to stick to the stent). I can also look forward to lifestyle changes and cardiac rehab. And no swimming for a few months? Whatever they say.

There have been so many people who’ve taken good care of me here. I regret that I don’t have virtually any of their names because things happen so fast and the people are so numerous, but the nurses have been wonderful and I know their names: Amy, Kirstin, Spencer, and Catherine.

I’ve also gotten lots of messages from friends, some via Gina, which I’ve really appreciated. If you want to reach me, bryanstearns@gmail.com works great.
