A long time ago, I was an amateur aviator: in the late 80's, I
learned to fly and got my instrument rating, bought an airplane,
and flew it around the country a few times. I even volunteered at
AirVenture, the big Experimental Aircraft Association convention
and fly-on in Oshkosh, Wisconsin: my friend Andy and I provided
computer support to the homebuilt judging group for almost a decade.
I got to see a lot of great homebuilt airplanes, but didn't want
to build one myself; I just wanted to fly the plane I had. <!--more-->

Eventually, though, the plane needed painting, and I was changing
to a startup job, so I sold it. Though I didn't plan it, I haven't
flown since.

Lately, though, I've found myself down a YouTube rathole of cool
aviation videos. Some of them are people documenting their homebuilt
projects, and I realized a few things:

- I have time and desire to build something now.

- <a href="https://vansaircraft.com" target="_blank">Van's Aircraft</a>,
  the oldest and most popular kit manufacturer, is only 45 minutes
  away, and their kits have gotten better over the years.

- Oh, and my heart attack means that getting an FAA medical certificate
  will be... complicated.

## Getting current

I was taught that there are three things you need to act as a
small-airplane pilot: a Private Pilot's license, a recent signoff
from an instructor that says your skills & knowledge are up to par,
and a recent medical certificate that says you're fit to fly.

The license never goes away, so I can already tick the first box.
I'll need to study a bit and find a new flight instructor for the
second one. And the medical? From what I read, I might be able to
convince the FAA to grant me a "special issuance" medical, if I can
provide them with evidence that my heart is now in good shape and
I'm not at high risk of having another heart event.

However, things have changed a bit since I last flew: there's also
an additional class of pilot's license, Sport Pilot, which lets you
fly a new class of aircraft, Light Sport, but only during the day
in good weather. (Light Sport planes are limited to 2 people, max
weight of 1320 pounds, and max speed of 138 miles per hour. Van's
sells a light-sport kit, <a href="https://www.vansaircraft.com/rv-12is/"
target="_blank">the RV-12</a>.) A Sport Pilot doesn't need an FAA
medical, just a valid driver's license, and certifies their own
fitness to fly.

As a licensed private pilot, I get to act as a Sport Pilot if I
want - I still have to get an instructor's signoff, and still could
only fly Light Sport aircraft during the day in good weather. Also,
I can't have been denied a medical certificate by the FAA.

I thought about it, and decided that I wanted to try to get the
special-issuance medical, primarily because I wanted to be able to
fly at night (I used to do it a lot in the old days!). Also, I
thought I might want to build and fly Van's newest and fastest
plane, <a href="https://www.vansaircraft.com/rv-14/" target="_blank">the
RV-14</a>.

I saw a bunch of postings on several aviation forums from <a
href="http://www.aeromedicaldoc.com" target="_blank">Dr. Bruce
Chien</a>, an aviation medical examiner who specializes in situations
like mine. I contacted Dr. Chien, and together we worked through
building the package that we'd submit to the FAA if it all looked
good at the end: he had me do a stress test, which showed my heart
is in great shape, and had me get a full workup from my cardiologist
that produced a report that covered my history, condition, medications,
lifestyle changes since my attack, discussion of what we're doing
to reduce future risk, etc. Once Dr. Chien thought everything
looked good to him, I visited him outside Chicago for a regular
aviation medical exam, which I also passed, and we submitted
everything to the FAA. Now we're waiting to see what they say,
which'll take 90 days or so (we hope!).

## So which plane do I want to build and fly?

In the meantime, <a href="https://chapters.eaa.org/EAA782"
target="_blank">EAA Chapter 782</a> (one of the two local chapters
I've joined) resumed its meetings; I went and met a couple of people
who'd built RV-12s. One was Stan VanGrunsven, the brother of Dick
VanGrunsven, the Van in Van's Aircraft. The other was John Scheck.
They answered a bunch of my questions and generally encouraged me,
and John offered to show me his airplane - I took him up on it, and
eventually he took me flying in it!

A short while later, Van's resumed factory tours and demo flights,
so I signed up for a flight in their RV-14. The tour was interesting,
and though the flight was fun, it really convinced me that the -14
was more airplane than I wanted: it'd cost about twice as much to
build (and take twice as long), and cost a lot more to operate. The
extra speed and range would only matter on long-distance flights,
which I'll probably do only a couple times a year -- I expect most
of my flying to be local.

The RV-12, by comparison, seems much closer to the kind of flying
I do, and even though it's a light-sport airplane, I can fly it at
night if I'm flying as a private pilot with a medical certificate.

The bad news is that all of Van's kits are backordered because of
a lot of increased demand (thanks, pandemic!). Because I was looking
at a five month lead time for the first subkit, I went ahead and
placed my order at the end of July. I've already started clearing
out the half of the garage in which I'll be building, and I'm hoping
to be pulling rivets by Christmas!
