A long time ago, I was an amateur aviator: in the late 80's, I
learned to fly and got my instrument rating, bought an airplane,
and flew it around the country a few times. I even volunteered at
AirVenture, the big Experimental Aircraft Association convention
and fly-in in Oshkosh, Wisconsin: my friend Andy and I provided
computer support to the homebuilt judging group for almost a decade.
I got to see a lot of great homebuilt airplanes, but didn't want
to build one myself; I just wanted to fly the plane I had. <!--more-->

Eventually, though, my plane needed painting, and I was changing
to a startup job, so I sold it. Though I didn't plan it, I haven't
flown since.

Lately, though, I've found myself down a YouTube rathole of cool
aviation videos. (Thanks, pandemic!) Some are made by people documenting
their homebuilt projects, and I realized a few things:

- Now that I'm pretty much retired, I have time and desire to build
  something now.

- <a href="https://vansaircraft.com" target="_blank">Van's Aircraft</a>,
  the oldest and most popular kit manufacturer, is only 45 minutes
  away, and their kits have gotten better over the years.

- Oh, but my recent heart attack means that getting an FAA medical certificate
  will be... complicated.

## Getting current

I was taught that there are three things you need to act as a
small-airplane pilot: a Private Pilot's license, a recent signoff
from an instructor that says your skills & knowledge are up to par,
and a recent medical certificate that says you're fit to fly. The
license never goes away, so I can already tick the first box.
I'll need to study a bit and find a new flight instructor for the
second one.

And the medical? I read that I might be able to convince the FAA to
grant me a "special issuance" medical, if I can provide them with
evidence that my heart is in good shape and I'm not at high
risk of having another heart event.

However, things have changed a bit since I last flew: there's also
an additional class of pilot's license, Sport Pilot, which lets you
fly a new class of aircraft, Light Sport, but only during the day
in good weather. (Light Sport planes are limited to 2 people, max
weight of 1320 pounds, and max speed of 138 miles per hour. Van's
sells a light-sport kit, <a href="https://www.vansaircraft.com/rv-12is/"
target="_blank">the RV-12iS</a>.) A Sport Pilot doesn't need an FAA
medical, just a valid driver's license, and certifies their own
fitness to fly.

As a licensed private pilot, I get to act as a Sport Pilot if I
want, without having to get a medical certificate - I still have to
get that instructor's signoff, and still could only fly Light Sport aircraft
during the day in good weather. Also (and this is the sticky part): _I can't
have been denied a medical certificate by the FAA._

I thought about it, and decided that I wanted to try to get the
special-issuance medical, primarily because I wanted to be able to
fly at night (I used to do it a lot in the old days!). Also, I
thought I might want to build and fly Van's newest and fastest
plane, <a href="https://www.vansaircraft.com/rv-14/" target="_blank">the
RV-14</a>.

So I went for it: I'd seen a bunch of postings on several aviation
forums from <a href="http://www.aeromedicaldoc.com" target="_blank">Dr. Bruce
Chien</a>, an aviation medical examiner who specializes in situations
like mine. I contacted Dr. Chien, and together we worked through
building the package that we'd submit to the FAA if it all looked
good at the end: he had me do a stress test, which showed my heart
is in great shape, and had me get a full workup from my cardiologist
that produced a report that covered my history, condition, medications,
lifestyle changes since my attack, discussion of what we're doing
to reduce future risk, etc. Once Dr. Chien thought everything
looked good to him, I visited him outside Chicago for a regular
aviation medical exam, which I also passed, and we submitted
everything to the FAA.

It took a couple of months, but the FAA granted my special-issuance medical!
It's good for two years, but I'll need to redo the stress test each year to
keep it valid.

(Another rule change I didn't mention above: the FAA has another medical program
called BasicMed, which lets any doctor certify me without the FAA's involvement.
It requires me to have been granted a medical certificate sometime since 2007... and
my new special-issuance medical counts! So, I might not even have to do the stress
tests every year, which is good because they're expensive!)

## So which plane do I want to build and fly?

In the meantime, <a href="https://chapters.eaa.org/EAA782"
target="_blank">EAA Chapter 782</a> (one of the two local chapters
I've joined) resumed its meetings; I went and met a couple of people
who'd built RV-12s. One was Stan VanGrunsven, the brother of Dick
VanGrunsven, the Van in Van's Aircraft. The other was John Scheck.
They answered a bunch of my questions and generally encouraged me,
and John offered to show me his airplane - I took him up on it, and
eventually he took me flying in it!

A short while later, Van's resumed factory tours and demo flights,
so I signed up for a flight in their RV-14. The tour was interesting,
and though the flight was fun, it really convinced me that the -14
was more airplane than I wanted: it'd cost about twice as much to
build (and take twice as long), and cost a lot more to operate. The
extra speed and range would only matter on long-distance flights,
which I'll probably do only a couple times a year -- I expect most
of my flying to be local.

The RV-12, by comparison, seems much closer to the kind of flying
I do, and even though it's a light-sport airplane, I can fly it at
night if I'm flying as a private pilot with a medical certificate.

The bad news is that all of Van's kits are backordered because of
a lot of increased demand (thanks again, pandemic!). I placed my order
for the first subkit in July, and it's still not here. In the meantime,
I've cleared out half of the garage, built a couple of workbenches, and
started collecting the many special tools I'll need.

I'll be posting my progress here, and might also post YouTube videos of
my own. Stay tuned!
