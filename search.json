This looked better (as he says) because fprof supports display of call chains, providing a lot more useful context. Better still, I found his followup post that taught me about how recent versions of Elixir come with a Mix task (mix profile.fprof) for profiling that produces friendlier output. The Mix task didn’t give me an easy way to wrap a slow test, though: it’s good for measuring an easily-isolatable bit of code like a single function, but sometimes tests involve setup that’s harder to isolate… so I cooked up this little macro and dropped it into my project’s test/test_helper.exs: defmodule FProf do defmacro profile(do: block) do content = quote do Mix.Tasks.Profile.Fprof.profile(fn -&amp;gt; unquote(block) end, warmup: false, sort: &quot;acc&quot;, callers: true) end Code.compile_quoted(content) end end",

      "excerpt"  : "I’ve been working on learning the Elixir programming language for the last several months, and after returning from ElixirConf a few weeks ago, I was inspired to try a small project with Nerves, a platform for building Elixir applications on small devices like the Raspberry Pi. Nerves provides a toolchain for building on the Mac which results in it writing a bootable microSD card that I boot in the Pi to try out my code. There’s a lot of complexity in what Nerves is doing for me, but one little bit (not Nerves’ fault!) annoyed me: I had to enter my login password every few minutes when Nerves wanted to write to the microSD card. I just found a way around this. The build command I use, every time I want to make a change, is this (I’ve broken it onto multiple lines for clarity) – (cd apps/project &amp;amp;&amp;amp; # switch into my app MIX_ENV=prod mix firmware &amp;amp;&amp;amp; # build the disk image (until [ -d /Volumes/BOOT ]; # wait for me to reinsert the card do sleep 1; done) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo chmod go+rw /dev/rdisk2 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; # Make the raw disk image writable MIX_ENV=prod mix firmware.burn -d /dev/rdisk2 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; # write to the SD card sync &amp;amp;&amp;amp; # flush changes - I&#39;m paranoid sleep 1) That sudo chmod command is the point of this post: without it, every time I did a new build, I had to enter my password, because Nerves invokes a tool called fwup to write the image, and fwup uses authopen to get authenticated access to the raw file. This permissions fix has to be done every time the microSD card is reinserted. (I’ve already set up my /etc/sudoers file to allow me to use sudo without entering my password each time.)",

I found suggestions to install Jeremy Kemper’s fork on Github, but though I’d added GitHub as a gem source, installing jeremy-ruby-prof didn’t work because that installed his version with that name, which didn’t help ActionController. What worked was: sudo gem uninstall jeremy-ruby-prof # be sure to uninstall old attempts! git clone git://github.com/jeremy/ruby-prof.git cd ruby-prof rake gem sudo gem install pkg/ruby-prof-0.6.1.gem Then, script/performance/request ran, but generated several strange error messages instead of producing results: Couldnt get a file descriptor referring to the console Could not get a file descriptor referring to the console Couldnt get a file descriptor referring to the console Could not get a file descriptor referring to the console This turned out to be because script/performance/request wants to use open to open its output files (a text file and an HTML document), but on Ubuntu, /usr/bin/open is a link to /usr/bin/openvt, which didn’t do what we want (and generated those error messages). I’m not sure what else uses open, but this did the right thing: it lets Firefox open the files: sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/firefox /usr/bin/open",

The Wikipedia page for TeachText (the application I’d written which provides this icon) doesn’t mention this trivia (nor that I wrote it!). After several years, TeachText was replaced by SimpleText, written by Tom Dowdy; Tom rightfully replaced my name with his; I’m just happy he kept the same style of icon. (I do rib Tom that TeachText was only 19K, where SimpleText was several times that in size.) UPDATE: Sadly, I learned recently that Tom passed away. I’ll miss him: like many people I got to work with at Apple back then, he was smart and fun.

I started writing a couple of years ago, but eventually the posts slowed to a trickle as my impulse to post was swamped by the urge to tinker with the look. I’ve just spent a bit of time upgrading to Wordpress 2.0 and doing my own theme (dig the live photo banner!), and now that I have, the old posts don’t fit. Coming soon: pictures in posts, and of course, Google ads. Update, April 4, 2006: Google ads: check! Update, July 21, 2016: Now moved to Jekyll and Github Pages, and Google ads went away a long time ago.",
